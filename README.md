# SSS: Smart Skill Support

SSS is an intelligent, role-aware chatbot system that processes multi-modal inputs (text, audio, images, documents), rephrases content based on user roles, and responds intelligently using **AutoGen**, **Ollama**, **Whisper**, **OCR**, and **Qdrant**.  
This application can also support automating upskilling or skill training for onboarded resources by curating content based on the userâ€™s skill/role.
